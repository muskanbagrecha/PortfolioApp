                Storytelling is an integral part of the growth of every business. The exponential growth in business
                data is paving the way for creating powerful dashboards that are capable of creating an impact with just
                a few words. Businesses are relying on these powerful dashboards to tell their stories, drive
                engagement, and influence audiences.

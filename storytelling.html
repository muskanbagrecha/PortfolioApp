            “Stories constitute the single most powerful weapon in a leader’s arsenal.” - Dr. Howard Gardner, professor
            at
            Harvard University

            Storytelling is an integral part of the growth of every business. The exponential growth in business data is
            paving the way for creating powerful dashboards that are capable of creating an impact with just a few
            words.
            Businesses are relying on these powerful dashboards to tell their stories, drive engagement, and influence
            audiences.

            In this article, we will understand the power of storytelling and what you can do to tell a fantastic story
            with
            your data.
        </p>

        <h3>The Importance of Storytelling</h3>
        <p>
            Imagine you have a 5-year-old. You’re reading out a story to him from his favorite book. The book is filled
            with pictures from illustrations to cartoonish drawings. The book has fewer words and yet you and your kid
            find yourselves completely absorbed in the story. Now imagine a data dashboard in place of the storybook.
            The visualizations, if presented in the right way, can have a profound impact on the users. In fact, as
            things become more complex, we as humans tend to go back to how we learned new things when we were smaller -
            through visuals. It is easier to understand the data when the figures and content are depicted in images
            that paint a story.
            The exponential growth in business data is helping businesses and stakeholders make data-driven decisions in
            order to take appropriate actions. However, it so happens that sometimes the dashboards are bombarded with
            data points which makes it overwhelming and confusing.
            In order to make the data and insights more meaningful, they need to be woven into a compelling story. This
            makes the data more consumable, allowing stakeholders to act better for the growth of the business.

        <h3>
            Practical Tips to Improve Your Data Storytelling
        </h3>
        <h4>
            Understand your user personas
        </h4>
        <p>It is very important to understand the expectations of your stakeholders. So ask yourself what are the
            metrics that matter to them and what kind of analysis is important to them. Also, have a clear understanding
            of whether your stakeholders want high-level reporting or if they are interested in the granular details -
            in which case you can incorporate drill-down visuals. </p>
        <h4>Be a great interrogator</h4>
        <p>
            In order to paint great stories, you need to be a great interrogator first. Ask yourself questions like: Why
            do these numbers and trends matter at all? How does this information impact the stakeholders? Am I really
            presenting something which will allow my audience to know their next step of action?
        </p>

        <h4>Include the appropriate metrics
        </h4>
        <p>
            After you get to know more about your user personas and your data, it is time for you to pick out the most
            relevant metrics for your story. These metrics should have an actionable outcome. Keep in mind that these
            metrics should be for your intended stakeholders only as they will take the next action.
        </p>

        <h4>Visuals can be a game-changer
        </h4>
        <p>
            Picking out the right visualizations is fundamental to your successful storytelling. For instance, not many
            people can process and understand the information contained in tables. Worse yet, if the table has huge
            amounts of data, it can get difficult to go through the data and search for something. Data visualization
            can transform these massive pieces of data into easily understandable visual representations.

        </p>

        <p>
            Remember to adhere to the best practices while incorporating visualizations. Our guide to dashboard design
            principles will help you with the same.
            Context is very important
            Imagine a scenario where you are shown a figure which indicates the performance of a company. Now compare
            this
            to the scenario where you are shown the same figure along with the data indicating how it has increased or
            decreased from the past. Needless to say, the latter gives more context to the end-user and helps them
            understand whether the changes are for the good or bad. This is a very important factor of storytelling as
            sometimes, spikes in data can point towards certain events that may have affected it. Essentially, this can
            bring up questions such as why did it happen? In case of a negative trend, you can ask how it can be
            avoided,
            etc.
            Including indicators or warnings comparing your current performance with your target would be the cherry on
            the
            cake. This will show how your business is growing towards your annual goals.


        </p>
        <h4>
            Provide Interactivity

        </h4>
        <p>
            A well-designed dashboard should be able to guide the user on how to consume the content. This can be
            achieved through interactivity. An interactive dashboard enables users to drill down into the data so that
            they
            can see it in more detail. This allows the users to gain a deeper insight, enabling them to make informed
            decisions.

            Introducing comparison
            Sometimes, comparison can be introduced to show how two or more subjects, like A and B, really differ. It
            can
            raise questions such as why ABC performs better than XYZ or what should be focused on for improvement.

        </p>
        <h3>
            Wrapping Up
        </h3>
        <p>
            Analysts should be able to deliver meaningful insights which can be grasped effortlessly. A good dashboard
            should be able to relay the most important information which can prompt the next step of action from the
            stakeholders. A good data story can bring facts to life and leave a profound impact.

            When in doubt, ask someone to look at the dashboard for a few seconds. Then ask them if they can recall the
            information. If they are able to recall most of the things, it is a good sign and means that your dashboard
            is
            relaying the information effectively.
